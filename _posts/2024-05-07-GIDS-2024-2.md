## Overview

The [Great International Developer Summit](https://developersummit.com/) (GIDS) 2024 took place from 23rd to
26th April at IISc Bangalore, featuring over 150 tech talks with some well-known speakers.
Sponsored by leading tech firms, including D.E. Shaw India, my workplace, the conference provided a fantastic
learning experience. I had a blast learning new concepts and networking with the speakers when I attended on the
25th and 26th.

This blog post is a documentation of my takeaways from the talks on 26th April. You can find the 25th April's
post [here]({% post_url 2024-05-03-GIDS-2024-1 %}).

As mentioned before, all of the talks will be uploaded to SaltMarch on 17th May 2024. I’ll link here once it’s up.

## Talks

### Digital Modernization through accessibility - Scott Davis

Abstract: [https://developersummit.com/session/digital-modernization-through-accessibility](https://developersummit.com/session/digital-modernization-through-accessibility)

Scott's keynote talk was a compelling argument to make accessibility a part of product design decisions.
While the takeaways I've documented capture the essence of his presentation, they don't fully convey
the impact it had. 

1. **Accessibility is more than just addressing disability; it's about giving users different means of accessing technology.**
    While we already interact with smartphones through sight, hearing, and touch, ture accessiblity means
    ensuring that everyone, regardless of their abilities, can use your product.
2. **Big Tech is radically re-defining how we interact with technologies.** Some interesting examples are,
    user interactions on the Apple Vision Pro, and double tap gesture on Apple Watch 9. Most of Gen Z
    watches videos with subtitles or closed captions.
3. Products should be designed with universal accessibility in mind. **While the Web is inherently**
    **designed to be accessible, it's often the practices of web developers that cripple it.** When used correctly,
    HTML adheres to Web Content Accessiblity Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 guidelines, which lays down the standards for
    web accessiblity. It's necessary to give users options to engage with content using all senses such as
    subtitles, closed captions, and alt text.
4. In addition to the accessibility guidelines, the web offers APIs such as the Web Speech API and Screen
    Reader APIs, which can be integrated with a few lines of code. Despite the availability of such tools
    to create accessible products, **there is still a need for a shift in mindset regarding accessibility.**

### Evolutionary Architectures - Rebecca Parsons

Abstract: [https://developersummit.com/session/evolutionary-architectures](https://developersummit.com/session/evolutionary-architectures)

1. Software architectures need to plan for unplannable and completely unforseeable evolutionary changes.
    For e.g., scale of trading increasing from few dozen transactions a day to millions of transactions
    per second, evolution of JavaScript libraries etc. This should be guided by System's requirements.
2. You can't make evolutionary code if you don't understand it. Make it testable.
3. Refactoring databases is important to make data evolution possible. CD is an important technique for
    evolutionary architectures. Have contract testing between systems.
4. Postel's Law - Be liberal in what you accept, and conservative in what you send.
5. Conway's Law - Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly) will produce a design whose
    structure is a copy of the organization's communication structure.
6. When gather requirements, ask for outcomes of the project, not implementations. This is necessary to
    maintain contract while still evolving.
7. An evolutionary architecture supports building systems that allow architects and developers to make
    sweeping changes to the most important parts of their systems with confidence. It covers practices
    that allow developers to build continual architectures, which evolve cleanly without the need for
    a crystal ball.
8. incremental change, and fitness functions
