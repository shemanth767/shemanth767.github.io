I'm a Senior Member Technical at D. E. Shaw India on Mondays to Fridays. On weekends, I learn whatever I find
fascinating at the moment in the Software Dev world. This blog documents some of those adventures.

Find more about me on my [personal website](https://www.saihemanth.com/).

Needless to say, all views and opinions are my own.
