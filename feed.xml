It has a lot of moving parts, but AWS made it so simple to manage and synchronize them. Description EC2 Instance EC2 Instance is the t3a.small server that I’m renting to run NextCloud on.

More formally, as I had mentioned in my previous blog post, I was looking to replace Google Drive and Photos with something self hosted and OSS. It was also the right time as I was bumping against the 15GB free limit on my Google Drive.

This includes Google Photos, Google Drive, One Drive, and Di... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>I finally understand Declarative Programming</title><link href="https://blog.saihemanth.com//posts/I-Finally-Understand-Declarative/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="I finally understand Declarative Programming" /><published>2022-01-29T09:00:00+05:30</published> <updated>2022-02-13T11:31:09+05:30</updated> <id>https://blog.saihemanth.com//posts/I-Finally-Understand-Declarative/</id> <content src="https://blog.saihemanth.com//posts/I-Finally-Understand-Declarative/" /> <author> <name>Sai Hemanth B</name> </author> <category term="Programming" /> <summary> Background Discussions surrounding declarative and functional programming have been on the rise over the past few years.
